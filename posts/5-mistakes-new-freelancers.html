    <h2>5 Mistakes New Freelancers Make — and How to Avoid Them</h2>
    <p>Starting your freelance journey is exciting, but it’s easy to make mistakes that can slow down your growth or cost you clients. Whether you're offering writing, design, coding, or virtual assistance, avoiding these common pitfalls will give you a smoother path to success.</p>
    
     <div class="cards-container">
    <div class="card">
    <h2>1. Undervaluing Your Work</h2>
    <p>Many beginners charge too little because they feel unqualified or desperate for work. This not only hurts your earnings but also sets low expectations for future clients. Research market rates and price your services with confidence — your time and effort are valuable.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Even as a beginner, never work for free unless it’s for strategic experience or portfolio building.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
    <h2>2. Offering Too Many Services at Once</h2>
    <p>Trying to be a writer, designer, video editor, and VA at once makes your profile look unfocused. Clients prefer specialists over generalists.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on 1–2 services you're passionate about and can improve over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
    <h2>3. Skipping Clear Agreements with Clients</h2>
    <p>Some freelancers start work without written confirmation of scope, timeline, or payment. This often leads to delays, scope creep, or even unpaid work.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always get the project details in writing — even a simple email or message can protect you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
    <h2>4. Saying Yes to Every Client</h2>
    <p>Not all clients are good clients. Some pay late, make unreasonable demands, or undervalue your work. Saying yes to everyone can lead to burnout.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose clients who respect your time and treat your work professionally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
    <h2>5. Waiting for Clients to Find You</h2>
    <p>Creating a profile and waiting isn't enough. You need to be proactive — apply for jobs, network, post on social platforms, and stay visible.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Set aside time weekly to market yourself. The more you show up, the more you grow.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Everyone makes mistakes, but knowing what to avoid gives you a head start. Freelancing in 2025 is full of opportunity — be smart, be focused, and keep improving. Your dream clients are out there!</p>
